## Testing Methodologies

### Black-box Testing:
- Proficient in black-box testing techniques, focusing on validating the functionality of software without examining its internal structure or code.
- Skilled in designing test cases based on external specifications, user requirements, and system behavior to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
- Utilize black-box testing for functional testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and regression testing to identify defects and verify system functionality from an end-user perspective.

### White-box Testing:
- Experienced in white-box testing methods, involving the examination of internal code structure and logic to validate program flows and data paths.
- Proficient in creating test cases based on code analysis, control flow, and data flow to verify code correctness and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Employ white-box testing for unit testing, integration testing, and code coverage analysis to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

### Exploratory Testing:
- Skilled in exploratory testing techniques, emphasizing simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution to uncover defects and assess software behavior dynamically.
- Proficient in exploratory testing sessions, where tests are executed without predefined test cases, allowing for flexibility, creativity, and adaptability in testing approaches.
- Utilize exploratory testing to complement structured testing methodologies, identify edge cases, and uncover unforeseen issues, enhancing overall test coverage and effectiveness.

### Agile Testing:
- Well-versed in agile testing principles and practices, emphasizing collaboration, continuous feedback, and iterative development cycles.
- Experienced in working within agile development environments such as Scrum or Kanban, participating in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews to align testing activities with project goals.
- Adapt testing strategies and techniques to accommodate changing requirements, prioritize test cases based on user stories, and ensure timely delivery of high-quality software increments.
